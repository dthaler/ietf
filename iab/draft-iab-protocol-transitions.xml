    <abstract>
      <t> Over the many years since the introduction of the Internet Protocol,
          we have seen a number of transitions from one protocol or technology to another,
          throughout the protocol stack.  Many protocols and
          technologies were not designed to enable smooth transition to
          alternatives or to easily deploy extensions, and thus some transitions,
          such as the introduction of IPv6, have been difficult.  This document
          attempts to summarize some basic principles to enable future transitions,
          and also summarizes what makes for a good transition plan.
      </t>

    <section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
      <t> A "transition" is "the process or period of changing from one state
          or condition to another".  There are several types of such transitions,
          including both technical transitions (e.g., changing protocols or
          deploying an extension) and organizational transitions (e.g., changing
          what organization manages the IETF web site, or the RFC production center).
          This document focuses solely on technical transitions, although some
          principles might apply to other types as well.
      </t>
      <t> There have been many IETF and IAB RFCs and IAB statements discussing
          transitions of various sorts.  Most are protocol-specific documents
          about specific transitions.  For example, some relevant ones in which
          the IAB has been involved include:
      </t>
      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t> IAB RFC 3424 <xref target="RFC3424"/> recommended that any technology
              for so-called "unilateral self-address fixing (UNSAF)" across NATs
              include an exit strategy to transition away from such a mechanism.
              Since the IESG, not the IAB, approves IETF documents, the IESG
              thus became the body to enforce (or not) such a requirement.
          </t>
          <t> IAB RFC 4690 <xref target="RFC4690"/> gave recommendations around
              internationalized domain names. It discussed issues around the process
              of transitioning to new versions of Unicode, and this resulted in the
              creation of the IETF Precis WG to address this problem.
          </t>
          <t> The IAB statement on "Follow-up-work on NAT-PT"
              <xref target="IabIpv6TransitionStatement"/> pointed out gaps at the time
              in transitioning to IPv6, and this resulted in the rechartering of the
              IETF Behave WG to solve this problem.
          </t>
      </list></t>
      <t> More recently, the IAB has done work on more generally applicable principles,
          including two RFCs.
      </t>
      <t> IAB RFC 5218 <xref target="RFC5218"/> on "What Makes for a Successful Protocol?"
          studied specifically what factors contribute to, and detract from,
          the success of a protocol and it made a number of recommendations.  It
          discussed two types of transitions: "initial success" (the transition
          to the technology) and extensibility (the transition to updated
          versions of it).  The principles and recommendations in that document
          are generally applicable to all technical transitions. Some important principles 
          included:
      </t>
      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t> Incentive: Transition is easiest when the benefits come to those bearing the costs.
              That is, the benefits should outweigh the costs at *each* entity.
              Some successful cases did this by providing incentives (e.g., tax breaks),
              or by reducing costs (e.g., freely available source), or by imposing
              costs of not transitioning (e.g., regulation), or even by narrowing
              the scenarios of applicability to just the cases where benefits do    
              outweigh costs at all relevant entities.
          </t>
          <t> Incremental Deployability: Backwards compatibility makes transition easier.
              Furthermore, transition is easiest when changing only one entity still
              benefits that entity.  In the easiest case, the benefit immediately
              outweighs the cost and so entities are naturally incented to transition.
              More commonly, the benefits only outweigh the costs once a significant
              number of other entities also transition.  Unfortunately, in such cases,
              the natural incentive is often to delay transitioning.
          </t>
          <t> Total Cost: Don't underestimate the cost of things other than the
              hardware/software itself.  For example, operational tools and processes,
              personnel training, business model (accounting/billing) dependencies,
              and legal (regulation, patents, etc.) costs all add up.
          </t>
          <t> Extensibility: Design for extensibility <xref target="RFC6709"/> so that
              things can be fixed up later.
          </t>
      </list></t>
      <t> IAB RFC 7305 <xref target="RFC7305"/> reported on a IAB workshop
          on Internet Technology Adoption and Transition (ITAT).  Like
          RFC 5218, this workshop also discussed economic aspects of transition,
          not just technical aspects.  Some important observations included:
      </t>
      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t> Early-Adopter Incentives: Part of Bitcoin's strategy was extra incentives
              for early adopters compared to late adopters.  That is, providing a long-term 
              advantage to early
              adopters can help stimulate transition even when the initial costs outweigh
              the initial benefit.
          </t>
          <t> Policy Partners: Policy-making organizations of various sorts (RIRs,
              ICANN, etc.) can be important partners in enabling and facilitating
              transition.
          </t>
      </list></t>
      <t> The remainder of this document continues the discussion started in those two RFCs
          and provides some additional thoughts on the topic of transition strategies
          and plans.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Transition vs. Co-existence" anchor="coexist">
        <t> There is an important distinction between a strict "flag-day" style transition
            where an old mechanism
            is immediately replaced with a new mechanism, vs. a looser co-existence based
            approach where transition proceeds in stages where a new mechanism is first
            added alongside an existing one for some overlap period, and then the old
            mechanism is removed at a later stage.
        </t>
        <t> When a new mechanism is backwards compatible with an existing mechanism, transition is
            easiest, and the difference between the two types of transition is not 
            particularly significant.
            However, when no backwards compatibility exists (such as in the IPv4 to IPv6 transition),
            a transition plan must choose either a "flag day" or a period of co-existence.
            When a large number of entities are involved, a flag day becomes impractical.
            Coexistence, on the other hand, involves additional costs of maintaining two
            separate mechanisms during the overlap period which could be quite long.
            Furthermore, the longer the overlap period, the more the old mechanism might
            get further deployment and thus increase the overall pain of transition.
        </t>
        <t> Often the decision between a "flag day" and a sustained co-existence period
            may be difficult, such as in the case of IDNA2008 
            <xref target="RFC5891"/>
            <xref target="RFC5895"/>
            and Unicode TR46
            <xref target="TR46"/>.
        </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Translation/Adaptation Location">
        <t> A translation or adaptation mechanism is often required if the old and new
            mechanisms are not interoperable.  Care must be taken when determining
            where such a translator is best placed. 
        </t>
        <t> Requiring a translator in the middle of the path can hamper end-to-end
            security and reliability.  For example, see the discussion of 
            network-based filtering in <xref target="RFC7754"/>.
        </t>
        <t> On the other hand, requiring a translation layer within an
            endpoint can be a resource issue in some cases, such as if the endpoint
            could be a constrained node <xref target="RFC7228"/>.
        </t>
        <t> Any transition strategy for a non-backward-compatible mechanism should 
            include a discussion of where it is placed and a rationale. The transition 
            plan should also consider the transition away from the use of translation 
            and adaptation technologies.
        </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Transition Plans">
        <t> A review of the case studies described in Appendix A suggests 
            that a good transition plan includes at least the following 
            components: an explanation of incentives for each entity involved, 
            a description of the phases of the transition along with a 
            proposed timeline, a method for measuring the transition's success, 
            a contingency plan for failure of the transition, and an effective 
            method for communicating the plan to the entities involved and 
            incorporating their feedback thereon. We recommend that such 
            criteria be considered when evaluating proposals to transition to 
            new or updated protocols. Each of these components is discussed in 
            the subsections below.
        </t>

        <section title="Explanation of Incentives">
            <t> A transition plan should explain the incentives to each
                involved entity to support the transition. Note here that 
                many entities other than the endpoint applications and 
                their users may be effected, and the barriers to transition 
                may be nontechnical as well as technical. When considering
                these incentives, also consider network operations tools, 
                practices, and processes, personnel training, accounting and
                billing dependencies, and legal and regulatory incentives.
            </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Description of Phases and Proposed Timeline">
            <t> Transition phases might include pilot/experimental deployment, 
                coexistence, deprecation, and removal phases for a transition
                from one technology to another incompatible one. 
            </t>

            <t> Timelines are notoriously difficult to predict and impossible
                to impose on uncoordinated transitions at the scale of the
                Internet, but rough estimates can help all involved entities
                to understand the intended duration of each phase.
            </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Measurement of Success">
            <t> The degree of deployment of a given protocol or feature at a 
                given phase in its transition can be measured differently,
                depending on its design. For example, server-side protocols 
                and options which identify themselves through a versioning or 
                negotiation mechanism can be discovered through active
                Internet measurement studies. 
            </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Contingency Planning">
            <t> A contingency plan can be as simple as providing for indefinite
                coexistence between an old and new protocol.
            </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Communicating the Plan">
            <t> Many of the entities involved in a protocol transition may not
                be aware of the IETF or the RFC series, so dissemination 
                through other channels is key for sufficiently broad 
                communication of the transition plan. While flag days are 
                impractical at Internet scale, coordinated "events" such as 
                World IPv6 Launch may improve general awareness of an ongoing 
                transition.
            </t>
        </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security">
        <t> This document discusses attributes of protocol transitions.  Some
            types of transition can adversely affect security or privacy.  For
            example, requiring a translator in the middle of the path may hamper
            end-to-end security and privacy, since it creates an attractive target.
            For further discussion of some of these issues, see Section 5 of

    <section title="Case Studies">
        <t> Appendix A of <xref target="RFC5218"/> describes a number of case studies
            that are relevant to this document and highlight various transition problems
            and strategies (see for instance the Inter-Domain Multicast case study
            in Section A.4 of <xref target="RFC5218"/>).
            We now include several additional case studies that focus on transition
            problems and strategies.  Many other equally good case studies could have
            been included, but, in the interests of brevity, only a sampling is included
            here that is sufficient to justify the conclusions in the body of this document.
        </t>

        <section title="Explicit Congestion Notification">
            <t> Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) is a mechanism to replace
                loss as the only signal for the detection of congestion, with an
                explicit signal sent from a router to the recipient of a packet,
                then reflected back to the sender. It was standardized in 2000 
                in <xref target="RFC3168"/>, and the mechanism consists of two 
                parts: congestion detection in the IP layer, reusing two bits of 
                the old IP Type of Service (TOS) field, and congestion feedback 
                in the transport layer. Feedback in TCP uses two TCP flags, ECN 
                Echo and Congestion Window Reduced. Together with a suitably 
                configured active queue management (AQM), ECN can improve TCP 
                performance on congested links.
            </t>
            <t> The deployment of ECN is a case study in failed transition followed 
                by possible redemption. Initial deployment of ECN in the early and
                mid 2000s led to severe problems with some network equipment, including 
                home router crashes and reboots when packets with ECN IP or TCP 
                flags was received <xref target="TSV2007"/>. 
                This led to firewalls stripping ECN IP and TCP flags, or even 
                dropping packets with these flags set. This stalled deployment. 
                The need for both endpoints (to negotiate and support ECN) and 
                on-path devices (to mark traffic when congestion occurs) to 
                cooperate in order to see any benefits from ECN deployment was a 
                further issue. The deployment of ECN across the Interent had failed.
            </t>
            <t> In the late 2000s, Linux and Windows servers began defaulting to "passive ECN 
                support", meaning they would negotiate ECN if asked by the 
                client, but would not ask to negotiate ECN by default. This 
                decision was regarded as without risk: only if a client were 
                explicitly configured to negotiate ECN would any possible 
                connectivity problems surface. Gradually, this has increased 
                server support in the Internet from near zero in 2008, to 11% 
                of the top million Alexa webservers in 2011, to 30% in 2012, 
                to 65% in late 2014. In the meantime, the risk to connectivity 
                of ECN negotiation has reduced dramatically <xref target="PAM2015"/>,
                leading to ongoing work to make Windows, Apple iOS, OSX, and Linux clients 
                negotiate ECN by default. It is hoped that a critical mass of 
                clients and servers negotiating ECN will provide an incentive to 
                mark congestion on ECN-enabled traffic, thus breaking the logjam.

        <section title="Internationalized Domain Names">
            <t>The deployment of Internationalized Domain Names (IDN) has a long
               and complicated history.  This should not be surprising, since
               internationalization deals with language and cultural issues regarding
               differing expectations of users around the world, thus making it
               inherently difficult to agree on common rules. Furthermore,
               because human languages evolve and change over time, even if
               common rules can be established, there is likely to be a need to
               review and update them regularly.
            </t>
            <t>There have been multiple technical transitions related to IDNs, including
               the introduction of non-ASCII in DNS, the transition to each new version
               of Unicode, and the transition from IDNA 2003 to IDNA 2008.
               A brief history of the introduction of non-ASCII in DNS and the various
               complications that arose therein, can be found in section 3 of
               <xref target="RFC6055"/>.  IDNA 2003 however was limited to Unicode
               version 3.2 only, but as part of the design of IDNA 2008, one of the
               changes was designed to decouple its rules
               from any particular version of Unicode (see <xref target="RFC5894"/>,
               especially section 1.4, for more discussion of this point, and
               see <xref target="RFC4690"/> for a list of other issues with IDNA 2003).
               However, the transition
               from IDNA 2003 to IDNA 2008 itself presented a problem since
               IDNA 2008 did not preserve backwards compatibility with IDNA 2003 for
               a couple of codepoints.
               Investigations and discussions with affected parties led to the IETF
               ultimately choosing IDNA 2008 because the overall gain by moving to
               IDNA 2008 to fix the problems with IDNA 2003
               <!-- becoming independent of Unicode Version -->
               was seen to be much greater than the problems due to the few
               incompatibilities at the time of the change, as not many IDNs were in use,
               and even fewer that might see incompatibilities.
            </t>
            <t>A couple browser vendors in particular were concerned about the differences between
               IDNA 2003 and IDNA 2008, and the fact that if a browser stopped being
               able to get to some site, or unknowingly sent a user to a different
               (e.g., phishing) site instead, the browser would be blamed.  As such,
               any user-perceivable change from IDNA 2003 behavior would be painful
               to the vendor to deal with, and hence they could not depend on 
               solutions that would need action by other entities.
            </t>
            <t>Thus, to deal with issues like such incompatibilities, applications and client-side
               frameworks often want to map one string into another (namely, a string that
               would give the same result as when IDNA 2003 was used) before invoking DNS.
            </t>
            <t>To provide such mapping, the Unicode Consortium led published
               <xref target="TR46"/>
               that continued down the path of IDNA 2003 with a code point by code point
               selection mechanism. This was implemented by some,
               but never adopted by the IETF.
            </t>
            <t>Meanwhile, the IETF did not publish any mapping mechanism, but <xref target="RFC5895"/>
               was published on the Independent Submission stream.  In discussions around
               mapping, one of the key topics was about how long the transition should last.
               At one end of the duration spectrum is a flag day where some entities would
               be broken initially but the change would happen before IDN usage became even
               more ubiquitous.  At the other end of the spectrum is the need to maintain
               mappings indefinitely.  Local incentives at each entity who needed to change,
               however, meant that a short timeframe was impractical.
            </t>
            <t>There are many affected types of entities with very different
               incentives.  For example, the incentives affecting browser vendors,
               registries, domain name marketers and applicants, app developers, and protocol
               designers are each quite different, and the various solutions
               require changes by multiple types of entities, where the benefits
               do not always align with the costs.
               If there is some group (or even an individual) that is opposed to a
               change/transition and able to put significant resources behind their 
               opposition, transitions get a lot harder.
            </t>
            <t>Finally, it is worth pointing out that there are multiple naming contexts,
               and the protocol behavior within each naming context can be different.
               Hence applications and frameworks often encounter a variety of behaviors
               and may or may not be designed to deal with them.  See sections 2 and 3 of
               <xref target="RFC6055"/> for more discussion.
            </t>
            <t>In summary, all this diversity can cause problems for each affected entity,
               especially if a competitor does not have such a problem, e.g., for browser
               vendors if competing browsers do not have the same problems, or for a VoIP
               or gaming service administrator if competing services do not have the same
               problems.

        <section title="IPv6">
            <t>Twenty-one years after publication of <xref target="RFC1883"/>, the transition
               to IPv6 is still in progress. The first document to describe a
               transition plan (<xref target="RFC1933"/>, later obsoleted by <xref target="RFC2893"/>) 
               was published less than a year after the protocol itself. It recommended co-existence (dual-stack 
               or tunneling technology) with the expectation that over time, all hosts would have IPv6, and 
               IPv4 could be quietly retired.
            </t>
            <t> In the early stages, deployment was limited to peer-to-peer uses, tunneled
                over IPv4 networks.  For example, Teredo <xref target="RFC4380"/> aligned the cost
                of fixing the problem with the benefit, and allowed for incremental benefits to those
                who used it.
            </t>
            <t> Operating System vendors had incentives because with such tunneling protocols,
                they could get peer-to-peer apps working without depending on any infrastructure changes.
                That resulted in the main apps using IPv6 being in the peer-to-peer category
                (BitTorrent, XBox gaming, etc.).
            </t>
            <t> Router vendors had some incentive because IPv6 could be used within an
                intra-domain network more efficiently than tunneling, once the OS vendors already
                had IPv6 support and some special-purpose apps existed.
            </t>
            <!-- For most of that time, few organizations made significant progress in
                 deployment on the Internet.  
            -->
            <t>
               For content providers and ISPs, on the other hand, there was little incentive for
               deployment: there was no incremental benefit to deploying locally. 
               Since everyone already had IPv4,
               there was no network effect benefit to deploying IPv6. Even as proponents
               argued that workarounds to extend the life of IPv4--such as CIDR, NAT, and
               stingy allocations--made it more complex, IPv4 continued to work well enough
               for most applications. 
            </t>
            <t>Workarounds to NAT problems documented in <xref target="RFC6269"/> and <xref target="RFC7021"/>
               included ICE, STUN, and TURN, 
               technologies that allowed those experiencing the problems to deploy technologies to resolve 
               them. As with end-to-end IPv6 tunneling (e.g., Teredo), the
               incentives there aligned the cost of fixing the problem with the benefit, and allowed 
               for incremental benefits to those who used them. The IAB discussed NAT technology proposals 
               <xref target="RFC3424"/> and recommended they be considered short-term fixes, and said that
               proposals must 
               include an exit plan, such that they would decline over time. In particular, the IAB warned 
               against generalizing NAT solutions, which would lead to greater dependence on them. In some ways, 
               these solutions, along with other IPv4 development (e.g., the workarounds above, and 
               retrofitting IPsec into IPv4) continued to reduce the incentive to deploy IPv6. 
            </t>
            <t>Indeed, not until a few years after IPv4 runout in various Regional Address Registry 
               (RIR) regions did IPv6 deployment significantly increase. The RIRs and others conducted 
               surveys of different industries and industry segments to learn why people did not deploy 
               IPv6 <xref target="IPv6Survey2011"/> <xref target="IPv6Survey2015"/>, which commonly listed
               lack of a business case, lack of training, and lack 
               of vendor support as primary hurdles. Arguably forward-looking companies collaborated 
               with ISOC on World IPv6 Day and World IPv6 Launch to jump start global IPv6 deployment, 
               and arguably their work gave vendors incentives to support IPv6 well.  
                Key aspects of World IPv6 Day and World IPv6 Launch that contributed to their successes
                were the communication mechanism, and the measurement metrics and contingency plans
                that were announced in advance.
            </t>
            <t> Several efforts have been made to mitigate the lack of a business case. Some governments
               (South Korea, Japan) provided tax incentives to include IPv6. Other governments (Belgium, 
               Singapore) mandated IPv6 support by private companies. Few of these had enough value to 
               drive significant IPv6 deployment.
            </t>
            <t>The concern about lack of training is often a common issue in transitions. Because IPv4 is 
               so ubiquitous, its use is routine and simplified with common tools, and it is taught in 
               network training everywhere. While IPv6 deployment was low, ignorance of it was no 
               obstacle to being hired as a network administrator or developer.
               <!-- DT removed since I don't follow what this means
                  Nathalie Kunneke-Trennaman,
                  Trainer for RIPE-NCC said, "The hardest part of teaching IPv6 is teaching remedial IPv4."
                 -->
            </t>
            <t>Organizations with the greatest incentives to deploy IPv6 are those which continue to grow 
               quickly, even after IPv4 free pool exhaustion. Thus, ISPs have had varying levels of 
               commitment, based on the growth of their user base, services being added (especially video 
               over IP), and the number of IPv4 addresses they had available. Cloud-based providers, 
               including CDN and hosting companies, have been major buyers of IPv4 addresses, and several 
               have been strong deployers and advocates of IPv6. 
            </t>
            <t>Different organizations will use different transition models for their networks, based on 
               their needs. Some are electing to use IPv6-only hosts in the network with IPv6-IPv4 translation 
               at the edge.
               <!-- (e.g., Stateful NAT64 <xref target="RFC6146"/>)  -->
               <!-- such as a data center with SIIT-DC or NAT64, or a mobile network with 464xlat. -->

               Others are using dual-stack hosts with IPv6-only routers in the core of the network,
               and IPv4 tunneled or translated through them to dual-stack edge routers.
               <!-- DS-Lite, 464xlat, etc. -->

               Still others are using native dual-stack throughout the network, but that generally persists as an 
               interim measure: adoption of two technologies is not the same as transitioning from one 
               technology to another. 

               Finally, some walled gardens or isolated networks, such as management networks,
               use IPv6-only end-to-end.
            </t>
            <t>It is impossible to predict with certainty the path IPv6 deployment will have taken
               when it is complete.  Lessons learned so far include aligning costs
               and benefits (incentive), and ensuring incremental benefit (network effect, or backward
               compatibility). 
               <!-- DT removed since I disagree with this.  It did help, and that's why Behave we rechartered
                    at the direction of the IAB (see text earlier in the document that referenced that fact).

                  Better translation would not have helped, since it did not work for
                  protocols that use IP addresses (or other layer 3 information) in other parts of the packet.

            <t> HTTP/2 <xref target="RFC7540"/> is a new version of the popular HTTP protocol <xref target="RFC7230"/>.
                The original versions of HTTP (0.9 <xref target="HTTP0.9"/>, 1.0 <xref target="RFC1945"/>,
                and 1.1 <xref target="RFC2616"/>) have only small differences; each iteration made 
                small improvements over the previous version without making major changes.
            </t>
            <t> The changes in HTTP/2 are largely aimed at improving performance.  The primary 
                improvement is request multiplexing, which is supported by request prioritization
                and flow control.  HTTP/2 includes efficiency improvements with header
                compression <xref target="RFC7541"/> and binary framing.

            <section title="Bundling of Features with New Versions">
                <t> The bundling of additional constraints on a new version of a protocol could
                    affect adoption by making the transition more costly.  However, the transition
                    to a new version also represents an opportunity to improve multiple aspects of 
                    a protocol at the same time.
                </t>
                <t> The HTTP working group decided that a new version of the protocol represented
                    an opportunity to improve security posture.  HTTP/2 is much stricter about its
                    use of TLS.  In particular, a long list of TLS cipher suites are prohibited,
                    constraints are placed on the key exchange method, and renegotiation is prohibited.
                    These changes did cause deployment problems.  Though most were minor and transitory,
                    disabling renegotiation caused problems for deployments that relied on the feature
                    to authenticate clients and prompted new work to replace the feature.
                </t>
                <t> A number of other features or characteristics of HTTP were identified as
                    potentially undesirable. Several such features were considered for removal during
                    the design process.  This included trailers, the 1xx series of responses, certain
                    modes of request forms, and the unsecured (http://) variant of the protocol. For
                    each of these, the risk to the successful deployment of the new version was
                    considered to be too great to justify removing the feature.  However, deployment
                    of the unsecured variant of HTTP/2 remains extremely limited.

            <section title="Planning for Replacement">
                <t> HTTP/1.1 provides a mechanism, Upgrade, to transition to an entirely different
                    protocol.  That same facility was little used other than to enable the use of
                    WebSockets <xref target="RFC6455"/>.  However, with performance being a
                    primary motivation for HTTP/2, a new mechanism was needed to avoid spending
                    an additional round trip on this negotiation.  A new mechanism was added to
                    TLS to permit the negotiation of the new version of HTTP: Application Layer
                    Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) <xref target="RFC7301"/>.  Upgrade was used only
                    for the unsecured variant of the protocol.
                </t>
                <t> ALPN was identified as the way in which future protocol versions would be
                    negotiated.  The mechanism was well-tested during development of the
                    specification, which proved that new versions could be deployed safely and
                    easily using ALPN.  Several draft versions of the protocol were successfully
                    deployed during protocol development, and version negotiation was never shown
                    to be an issue.
                </t>
                <t> Confidence that new versions would be easy to deploy if necessary lead to a
                    particular design stance that might be considered unusual in light of the
                    advice in RFC 5218 <xref target="RFC5218"/>, though is completely consistent
                    with RFC 6709 <xref target="RFC6709"/>: many of
                    the ways in which the protocol might be extended were removed unless an
                    immediate need was understood. This decision was made on the basis that it
                    would be easier to revise the entire protocol than it would be to ensure that
                    an extension point was correctly specified and implemented such that it would
                    be available when needed.
